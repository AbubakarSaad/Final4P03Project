# Project Title

This project demonstrate solving n-puzzle by bfs, dfs, iddfs and greedy search. 

Project Guidelines:
Forms:
Comparison of performance and/or possible applications of two or more algorithms

Hand-In
Electronic copies of all source code and other material necessary to run your program(s),

Printouts of source code, and


Appropriate documentation. The documentation must include, as a bare minimum, a
description of the problem and algorithm(s), information on how to run your
program(s), and an analysis of the results obtained.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
